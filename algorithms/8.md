### 7. String to Integer (atoi)

[Leetcode 链接](https://leetcode.com/problems/string-to-integer-atoi/description/) 

#### 题目
Implement atoi which converts a string to an integer.

The function first discards as many whitespace characters as necessary until the first non-whitespace character is found. Then, starting from this character, takes an optional initial plus or minus sign followed by as many numerical digits as possible, and interprets them as a numerical value.

The string can contain additional characters after those that form the integral number, which are ignored and have no effect on the behavior of this function.

If the first sequence of non-whitespace characters in str is not a valid integral number, or if no such sequence exists because either str is empty or it contains only whitespace characters, no conversion is performed.

If no valid conversion could be performed, a zero value is returned.

Note:

Only the space character ' ' is considered as whitespace character.
Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−231,  231 − 1]. If the numerical value is out of the range of representable values, INT_MAX (231 − 1) or INT_MIN (−231) is returned.

```
Example 1:

Input: "42"
Output: 42
Example 2:

Input: "   -42"
Output: -42
Explanation: The first non-whitespace character is '-', which is the minus sign.
             Then take as many numerical digits as possible, which gets 42.
Example 3:

Input: "4193 with words"
Output: 4193
Explanation: Conversion stops at digit '3' as the next character is not a numerical digit.
Example 4:

Input: "words and 987"
Output: 0
Explanation: The first non-whitespace character is 'w', which is not a numerical 
             digit or a +/- sign. Therefore no valid conversion could be performed.
Example 5:

Input: "-91283472332"
Output: -2147483648
Explanation: The number "-91283472332" is out of the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
             Thefore INT_MIN (−231) is returned.
```

#### 题意解析

将字符串解析为数字，要注意一些 case： 
- "w123" => 0
- "  3a" => 3
- "3.14" => 3
- 如果数字小于 MinInt32 则返回 MinInt32
- 如果数字大于 MaxInt32 则返回 MaxInt32

#### 解决方案

- 先把前缀的空格遍历过滤掉
- 接着把 "+" 或者 "-" 取出，如果第一个非空格的字符不是加减号也不是数字，那么就返回 0
- 剩下的字符串一个个遍历，遇到非数字的字符串就终止

#### Go 代码
``` go
func myAtoi(str string) int {
	cnt := 0
	for cnt < len(str) && string(str[cnt]) == " " {
		cnt++
	}

	if cnt >= len(str) {
		return 0
	}

	positive := true
	switch string(str[cnt]) {
	case "-":
		positive = false
		cnt++
	case "+":
		cnt++
	}

	var res int64
	for ; cnt < len(str); cnt++ {
		t := string(str[cnt])
		v, err := strconv.Atoi(t)
		if err != nil {
			break
		}

		res = res*10 + int64(v)
		switch positive {
		case true:
			if res > math.MaxInt32 {
				return math.MaxInt32
			}

		case false:
			if res*-1 < math.MinInt32 {
				return math.MinInt32
			}
		}
	}

	if !positive {
		res = res * -1
	}
	return int(res)
}
